[Odin Project: Google Homepage](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav)

This is an Odin Project homework assignment to recreate the front page of Google. Overall, not a difficult project. The real head-scratcher I came across is how to get the microphone symbol onto the search bar! I've since moved onto other projects, but I still feel like I only did 98% of this project due to never figuring that out...
